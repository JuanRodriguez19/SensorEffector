November 6 2018 - 
Today is the PCB soldered milestone. In terms of my <a href = "https://github.com/JuanRodriguez19/SensorEffector/blob/master/Documentation/Power%20Switch%20Project%20Schedule.pdf ">Project Schedule </a> I am a bit behind from where I should be as I was not able to solder my whole board. This was due to not having the PCB made in time.
I have to solder pieces of wire to the vias and thats about it. When it comes to my <a href = "https://github.com/JuanRodriguez19/SensorEffector/blob/master/Documentation/PowerSwitchBudget.pdf">Budget </a>, nothing has changed as I have everything I need for now. Things may change in the future. I will finish the soldering on thursday in the prototype lab.

Finished my design for the <a href = "https://github.com/JuanRodriguez19/SensorEffector/blob/master/Documentation/TouchSensor_pcb.png">TouchSensorPCB </a>.

In terms of my budget, overall not much has changed in terms of having to order more parts or return things. One thing however was that for my wiring of the sensor and the Raspberry Pi, I required 3 200k ohm resistors in the circuit in order to get the correct address for the sensor. These items were taken from my school toolkit which I had with me before the semester.



October 23 2018 -
Finished Soldering my sensor on the breadboard.
Wired the Raspberry Pi to the sensor and got it to display the address through VNC viewer.
An issue that occured is that my sensor is currently assigned to address(29) which is one of the 5 possible address that it can have. The address I require is 2A.
I attemped to rewire so that I can meet the correct conditions for the address, however it has not worked yet so addtional work is required.

Finished Fritzing
