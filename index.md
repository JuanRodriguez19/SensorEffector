Today is the powerup milestone. I managed to get my correct address for the touch sensor being 2a and displayed it on the screen. In order to attach my circuit to the raspberry pi, I required another 20 pin socket to create more elevation as the board was too long and interfered with the usb hubs on the pi. I need to make a slight adjustment to my <a href = "https://github.com/JuanRodriguez19/SensorEffector/blob/master/Documentation/PowerSwitchBudget.pdf">Budget </a> for the inclusion of the addtional socket. In terms of actually getting to read something from my sensor, I ran into multiple issues resulting in me not being able to have it done by the end of class. I will need to work on it later this week as I am now behind. I am now following the
<href ="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-cap1188-breakout/python-circuitpython"> Adafruit site </a> which has code that should work with the pi. It requires the use of python which I am not familiar with at all so it will require some time to get working.<br>

Today is the PCB soldered milestone. In terms of my <a href = "https://github.com/JuanRodriguez19/SensorEffector/blob/master/Documentation/Power%20Switch%20Project%20Schedule.pdf ">Project Schedule </a> I am a bit behind from where I should be as I was not able to solder my whole board. This was due to not having the PCB made in time.
All I have left to do is solder pieces of wire to the vias and thats about it. When it comes to my <a href = "https://github.com/JuanRodriguez19/SensorEffector/blob/master/Documentation/PowerSwitchBudget.pdf">Budget </a>, nothing has changed as I have everything I need for now. Things may change in the future. I will finish the soldering on thursday in the prototype lab.
Once it seems it have everything operational, I need to check if it can read my sensor for next weeks milestone.

Finished my design for the <a href = "https://github.com/JuanRodriguez19/SensorEffector/blob/master/Documentation/TouchSensor_pcb.png">TouchSensorPCB </a>.

In terms of my budget, overall not much has changed in terms of having to order more parts or return things. One thing however was that for my wiring of the sensor and the Raspberry Pi, I required 3 200k ohm resistors in the circuit in order to get the correct address for the sensor. These items were taken from my school toolkit which I had with me before the semester.

Finished Soldering my sensor on the breadboard.
Wired the Raspberry Pi to the sensor and got it to display the address through VNC viewer.
An issue that occured is that my sensor is currently assigned to address(29) which is one of the 5 possible address that it can have. The address I require is 2A.
I attemped to rewire so that I can meet the correct conditions for the address, however it has not worked yet so addtional work is required.

Finished Fritzing
