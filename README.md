Finished my design for the <a href = "https://github.com/JuanRodriguez19/SensorEffector/blob/master/Documentation/TouchSensor_pcb.png">TouchSensorPCB </a>

Finished Soldering my sensor on the breadboard.
Wired the Raspberry Pi to the sensor and got it to display the address through VNC viewer.
An issue that occured is that my sensor is currently assigned to address(29) which is one of the 5 possible address that it can have. The address I require is 2A.
I attemped to rewire so that I can meet the correct conditions for the address, however it has not worked yet so addtional work is required.

Finished Fritzing
